title: "Automated Tests"

The primary reason for having automated tests is to know whether or not code _works_.

There are _other_ benefits to testing. [Adhering strictly to TDD](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheThreeRulesOfTdd)
informs better design decisions and provides in-depth documentation whose
validity can be proven in a relatively trivial amount of time by a passing test
suite. Those are benefits but they're not why I write tests.

I write tests to know if my code works and working code meets all the _product
requirements_ defined until today.

```
As listener Lindsey,
When I tap on the ListenWith app icon,
Then I see a list of the names of all my Spotify playlists,
So that I know what my listening options are.
```

New product requirements are discovered regularly and upon completing code to
satisfy the 50th requirement, it's nice to shortly know whether or not any of
the first 49 broke during the latest's development. Automated, system level,
_acceptance_ tests are the tests which assure me.

1. Tap the ListenWith app icon
2. Assert that Lyn's Spotify playlist names are listed

This test is truly reassuring.

Testing this behavior by asserting that tapping the app icon calls `func Begin()`
and that `func Begin()` renders a list of spotify playlists is much less beneficial.

Chaining together transitively-assuring unit tests couples your tests to your
implementation details and doesn't accurately reflect whether or not your code
works.
