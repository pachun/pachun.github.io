Try and keep names concise. Keep a [thesaurus.com][1] browser tab open while working. Type in phrases to get single word synonyms. You'll learn some useful terminology and get better at writing more maintainable code. Good names convey purpose, so if a short name just won't do, sacrifice brevity for clarity and camel case a whole sentence.

Reading other people's code brings out the imposter syndrome in us. Do the next person (and your future self) a favor and give exceptional thought to your variable and function names.
