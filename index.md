        Test Drive to Get 100% Coverage Thatâ€™s Not a Vanity Metric
      </a>
    </h2>
    <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
      A vanity metric looks good on paper but doesn't inform future strategies.
      It falsely increases confidence. Code coverage can be a vanity metric.
      100% test coverage means that the test suite runs every line of production
      code. That doesn't mean it exercises the code's entire intent.

      Since 2014, I've spent untold hours on each of 13 iOS app side projects.
      Three of them made it into the App Store. Not because Apple rejected the
      others, but because my enthusiasm for them fell away. I even stopped work
      on the project I consider to have been most successful, which accrued just
      over 2.5K users.

    </h2>
    <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
      Most of what I'm gonna say here has already been said really well by my
      favorite speaker, Sandi Metz. The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is
      overemphasized and misapplied. When you need a couple of lines of code
      that you've already written, copy and paste them.

    </h2>
    <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
      Some function components expand to manage a range of responsibilities.
      Tracking which parts of the function body relate to the task at hand gets
      harder. Use well-named hooks to separate concerns out of the function body
      and into their own files.

    </h2>
    <p class="blog-post-excerpt">
      Try and keep names concise. Keep a thesaurus.com browser tab open while
      working. Type in phrases to get single word synonyms. You'll learn some
      useful terminology and get better at writing more maintainable code. Good
      names convey purpose, so if a short name just won't do, sacrifice brevity
      for clarity and camel case a whole sentence.
